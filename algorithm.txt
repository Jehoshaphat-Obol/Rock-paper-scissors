1.    create a function called computer play that randomly returns either rock, paper or scissors. that will make the computer play
        create a variable called choice
        let choice store a random integer 1, 2 or 3
            **make sure that zero is not assigned in choice
                while zero is assigned to choice
                    assign another random integer 1, 2 or 3
                end while
            if the integer is 1 
                let the function return rock.
            else if the integer is 2
                let the function return paper
            else if the integer is 3
                let the function return scissors
            end if
            **mind case sensitivity

 ***initialize the score to [0][0] ie[player][computer] using an array
2.    create a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors.
            the function should take two parameters the playerSelection and computerSelection.
            the function should also return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: 'you lose! Paper beats rock'
            ***Get users input
            ***looking for the winner by comparing the parameters
                    if player = rock and computer = rock
                        then print it is a tie
                        return [0][0]
                    else if player = rock and computer = paper
                        then print you lose! paper beats rock
                        return [0][1]
                    else if player = rock and computer = scissors
                        then print you win! rock beats scissors
                        return [1][0]
                    else if player = paper  and computer = rock
                        then print you win! paper beats rock
                        return [1][0]
                    else if player = paper and computer =   paper
                        then print it is a tie
                        return [0][0]
                    else if player = paper and computer = scissors
                        then print you lose! scissors beat paper
                        return [0][1]
                    else if player = scissors and computer = rock
                        then print you lose! rock beats scissors
                        return [0][1]
                    else if player = scissors and computer = paper
                        then print you win! scissors beats rock
                        return [1][0]                      
                    else if player = scissors and computer = scissors
                        then print it is a tie 
                        return [0][0] 
                    else
                        then print out you've inputted the wrong move please refresh and try again
                    end if                                      
                a.  make the playerSelection case-insensitive so that user can input rock, Rock, ROCK or any other variation.
3.    write a new function that calls the play function and keeps records of the game
                    create a new array variable point
                    create an array to hold records
                    call the function above a get the return value for 5 iterations
                    assign the return value of the round into the point
                    add the points to the records

                    compare the computer's score with the players score and declare the winner
